Hey, thank you for really reading this. 

I know I know, the Images won't be enough to give me the tickets. 

I would like to at least justify myself.
 I'm always busy with family and friends. After work I usually help someone or pursue my date-based hobbies like firefighters or blowgun shooting. If I don't have to help my relatives or their friends/fix things on a weekend, there's still not much time left to actively work on projects like my HomeAssistant or the HomeServer.

I only had limited time this weekend and tried to use it as efficiently as possible. I hardly had time to save pictures and logs, otherwise I wouldn't have made any progress! So my evidence looks pretty bad overall. So, please be kind to me ;(

That's what I meant: I spent an entire hour just to write commits. That's a hour in which I wanted to continue my project. I can't explain it to myself, how so many People can get over 300 Hours!!! I mean do they have no work? They have massive projects that even most adults couldn't do. Btw. before you think I'm an adult, I am a 17 years old Trainee Living in Germany. I work 37,5h the week. No Holidays :(
